## 📡 How It Works

### 7-Step Processing Pipeline

#### 1️⃣ Data Acquisition
Download Sentinel-1 SAR images and SRTM elevation data for Haldwani region (29.10°N - 29.50°N, 79.40°E - 79.65°E)

#### 2️⃣ Preprocessing
Apply radiometric calibration, terrain correction, and speckle filtering using ESA SNAP toolbox

#### 3️⃣ Feature Extraction
Calculate:
- **Backscatter intensity** - Surface roughness indicator
- **Coherence** - Ground stability measure
- **Slope angle** - Terrain steepness
- **Aspect** - Slope orientation

#### 4️⃣ Rainfall Integration
Merge IMD rainfall data with SAR observations for temporal correlation analysis

#### 5️⃣ Risk Modeling
Apply machine learning algorithms to classify terrain into risk categories (Low/Medium/High)

#### 6️⃣ Validation
Cross-reference with historical landslide records achieving 95% overall accuracy

#### 7️⃣ Visualization
Generate interactive maps, charts, and reports accessible via web interface

## 🔬 SAR Technology Explained

### What is SAR?

**Synthetic Aperture Radar** uses radar waves instead of visible light, enabling:

✅ **24/7 Monitoring** - Works day and night  
✅ **All-Weather Capability** - Penetrates clouds and rain  
✅ **Millimeter Precision** - Detects tiny ground movements  
✅ **Vegetation Penetration** - Sees through forest canopy  

### How SAR Detects Landslides

1. **Satellite sends radar pulses** to Earth's surface
2. **Signal bounces back** with information about terrain
3. **Multiple images compared** to detect changes
4. **Ground movement calculated** from phase differences
5. **Risk assessed** based on deformation patterns

### Why Different Polarizations Matter

- **VV (Vertical-Vertical)**: Best for rough surfaces and vegetation penetration
- **VH (Vertical-Horizontal)**: Highlights volume scattering in forests
- **HH (Horizontal-Horizontal)**: Optimal for smooth surfaces
- **HV (Horizontal-Vertical)**: Sensitive to structural complexity

*This project primarily uses VV and VH polarizations from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR.*

### Risk Distribution
- **42%** High Risk Zones
- **38%** Medium Risk Zones  
- **20%** Low Risk Zones

### Rainfall-Movement Correlation
Strong positive correlation (R² = 0.78) between:
- Monsoon rainfall intensity
- Ground displacement velocity
- Landslide event frequency

### Peak Risk Period
**June - September** (Monsoon season)
- 3x higher landslide frequency
- Maximum ground displacement: 12cm
- Critical rainfall threshold: 450mm/month
